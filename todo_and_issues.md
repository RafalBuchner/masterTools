# TODO
## MTGlyphPreview
- improve tracking whenever the glyph is incompatible

## master compatibility table (mct)

problem with updating the font/glyphâ€“ I'm assuming that masterprocessor is messing with glyph.changed updates, therefore it resets the table's cells highlightings

## kink manager

Now I'm working on the highlighting in the MCT. I was able to get rid of the white gaps between the cells. Now I'm figuring out how to fix the issue, in which the highlighting resets. I realised that masterprocessor's font update can mess with that. Interesting thing: if I remove any point, number of ran glyph.changed callbacks is different than when I'm adding the point> Also take in the considaration that masterprocessor.font.update can mess with it.

DO WE NEED UPDATE FONTS connected with GLYPH.CHANGED?
